I'm Thyroidgland. A 28 year old designer by day and a twitch streamer by night hailing from of Philadelphia. Streaming a whole ton of Overwatch and occasionally some Path of Exile. Feel free to [drop a follow](http://www.twitch.tv/thyroidgland) and stop in when I'm live and say hello. I love meeting new streameres and helping out however I can.

### Where did the name Thyroidgland come from?

A few friends and I used to play a lot of World of Warcraft back in the day and we started a small guild together called Anatomy. We all were various parts of the human body and I decided on Thyroidgland. I control and balance your hormones, how awesome is that?

### Currently Playing:

* Overwatch
* Path of Exile
* Mass Effect 3

### How do I request overlays for certain games?

I'd recommend reaching out to me via [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/thyroidgland_tg) or [email](mailto:thyroidgland.twitch@gmail.com). I'll do my best to respond as quickly as possible, balancing a full time job and freelance along the way gets tough sometimes. Thanks in advance for your patience.
