## Path of Exile Stream Overlay
**This version comes with 2 stylings. One with a webcam area, and one without.**

Overlay that matches the visual styling of Path of Exile. Lightweight and doesn't get in the way of the gameplay. Webcam and stream overlays are separated into different files for any streamers who don't have a webcam.

#### **SIZING**
All overlays are designed at a 16:9 ratio and exported at 1920x1080 resolution If you're streaming at a 1280x720 output just resize the graphic within your streaming app and it will keep the same ratio. All files are saved at 1920x1080 so that when you layer each image into your software it all aligns pixel perfect. No need for manual adjustments. Everything comes out of the box visually balanced giving your stream that professional apperance.

#### **WHAT IMAGES DO YOU GET?**
* Music Now Playing Section
* Background Overlay
* Webcam Area
* Follower Goal Text
* Latest Follower Text

#### **CREDITS**

Everything here is free to use. All I ask is you give me some credit in your profile info, or just tell your friends about it! Shoot me a message with your stream and if you're using the overlay, I would love to see it in action.
